# US Births Analysis (2016‚Äì2021)

This project analyzes trends in birth rates across the United States from 2016 to 2021.  
Using a combination of Tableau, and Python, I explored how births varied by year, state, month, day of week, maternal age, and education level.

## Technologies Used

- **Tableau ** ‚Äî for interactive dashboards and storytelling
- **Python ** ‚Äî for deeper data manipulation and visualization

## Project Objectives

- Understand national and regional birth trends between 2016‚Äì2021
- Identify seasonal and weekday patterns in births
- Explore how maternal age and education impact birth rates
- Highlight unusual shifts (e.g., 2020 COVID-19 effects)

- Most births were to mothers aged **25‚Äì34**, especially in the **High School to Some College** education range.
- There was a noticeable dip in births around mid-2020, likely due to the pandemic.
- Some states (like California and Texas) consistently had the highest total births.

## Dataset Description
